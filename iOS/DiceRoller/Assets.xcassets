The file "iOS/DiceRoller/Assets.xcassets" is a directory that stores the image assets for the iOS app. It's not a code file, so it doesn't contain any code. Instead, it contains image files. 

For this app, we would add the polyhedral dice icon image file to this directory. The image file should be in .png or .jpg format and should be named "polyhedral_dice_icon.png" or "polyhedral_dice_icon.jpg". 

Please note that the actual generation of image files is beyond the scope of this AI model.
